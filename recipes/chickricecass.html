        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Chicken and Rice Casserole is exactly what it sounds like, chicken
            and rice in a casserole form, but with a few more ingredients. It also contains
            cream of chicken soup, celery soup, and mushroom soup to give it some
            extra flavor. It is a cheap dinner to make for the family and kids will
            love it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It takes little time and (depending on how big of a casserole 
            dish you have) can serve a lot of people. It takes about an hour
            and 20 minutes to make, and can yield six servings. It can easily
            be stored in the fridge or freezer to have as left overs, or to
            make and heat up another day.
